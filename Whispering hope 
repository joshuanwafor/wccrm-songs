"Whispering Hope," a song written by Septimus Winner in 1868 under the pseudonym Alice Hawthorne:

---

**Verse 1:**
Soft as the voice of an angel,
Breathing a lesson unheard,
Hope with a gentle persuasion
Whispers her comforting word:
Wait till the darkness is over,
Wait till the tempest is done,
Hope for the sunshine tomorrow,
After the shower is gone.

**Chorus:**
Whispering hope,
Oh, how welcome thy voice,
Making my heart
In its sorrow rejoice.

**Verse 2:**
If in the dusk of the twilight,
Dim be the region afar,
Will not the deepening darkness
Brighten the glimmering star?
Then when the night is upon us,
Why should the heart sink away?
When the dark midnight is over,
Watch for the breaking of day.

**Chorus:**
Whispering hope,
Oh, how welcome thy voice,
Making my heart
In its sorrow rejoice.

**Verse 3:**
Hope, as an anchor so steadfast,
Rends the dark veil for the soul,
Whither the Master has entered,
Robbing the grave of its goal.
Come then, oh, come, glad fruition,
Come to my sad weary heart.
Come, O Thou blest hope of glory,
Never, oh, never depart.

**Chorus:**
Whispering hope,
Oh, how welcome thy voice,
Making my heart
In its sorrow rejoice.
