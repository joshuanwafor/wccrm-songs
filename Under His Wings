Verse 1
Under his wings, I am safely abiding. Tho' the night deepens and tempests are wild, still i can trust him; I know he will keep me. He has re-deemed me, and i am his child.


Verse 2
Under his wings, What a refuge in sorrow, how the heart yearningly turns to His rest often when earth has no balm for my healing, There i find comfort, and there i am blest.


Verse 3
Under his wings, oh, what precious enjoyment! There will i hide till life's trials are over; sheltered, protested, no evil can harm me, Resting in Jesus, i am safe ever more.

Chorus
Under His wings, Under his wings, Who from his love can sever? 
Under His wings, my soul shall abide, safely abide forever.
