"Let Jesus Fix It for You" by Rev. F.C. Barnes:

---

**Chorus:**
Let Jesus fix it for you,
For He knows just what to do;
Whenever you pray, let Him have His way,
And He will fix it for you.

**Verse 1:**
When troubles come,
And you're feeling down,
And you need someone to be around,
Just call on Jesus,
He's the one who cares,
He will be with you everywhere.

**Chorus:**
Let Jesus fix it for you,
For He knows just what to do;
Whenever you pray, let Him have His way,
And He will fix it for you.

**Verse 2:**
If you're in doubt,
And you can't find your way out,
He will see you through,
Just call on Jesus,
He will be your friend,
He's the only one who cares for you.

**Chorus:**
Let Jesus fix it for you,
For He knows just what to do;
Whenever you pray, let Him have His way,
And He will fix it for you.
