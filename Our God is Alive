Verse 1
There is, beyond the azure blue, a God concealed from human sight, He tinted skies with heav'nly hue and framed the worlds with His great might.

Verse 2
There was, a long, long time ago, a God whose voice the prophets heard, He is the God that we should know, who speaks from His inspired Word.

Verse 3
Secure is life from mortal mind, God holds the germ within His hand, Tho' men may search, they cannot find, for God alone does understand.

Verse 4
Our God, whose Son upon the tree, a life was willing there to give, That He from sin might set man free, and evermore with Him could live. 

Chorus
There is a God, He is alive, in Him we live, and we survive; From dust our God created man, He is our God, the great I AM.
