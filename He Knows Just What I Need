Verse 1
My Jesus knows when i am lonely, He knows each pain, He sees each tear; He understands each lonely heart-ache, He understands because he cares.

Verse 2
My Jesus knows when i am burdened, He knows how much my heart can bear, He lifts me up when i am sinking, And brings me joy beyond compare.

Verse 3
When other friends seem to forget me, When skies are dark, when hope is gone, By faith i feel His arms about me, And hear him say you're not alone.

Chorus
My Jesus knows just what i need, Oh he knows just what i need, He satisfies and every need supplies, Yes, He knows just what I need.
